Decision: Promote `manifest_html10.tsv` as `manifest_current.tsv`  
Reason: Stable HTML-first manifest used for sample10 baseline  
Alternatives: `manifest_html10_bad.tsv` archived due to known path issues  
Impact: Downstream sampling and extraction now depend on this manifest

Decision: Freeze the repository directory structure as a stable interface (no renames or relocations)
Reason: Prevent recurring breakage from hard-coded paths and reduce refactor churn; improve long-term reproducibility and maintainability
Scope: Top-level directories src/, data/, runs/, project/ and root files README.md, requirements.txt, .gitignore are frozen in name and location
Allowed: Add new files/subfolders within these directories; add new stages under src/ (e.g., stage6_*); add new top-level directories only if existing ones are not moved/renamed
Disallowed: Renaming or relocating any frozen directory; moving outputs to alternative roots (e.g., data/results replacing runs/); restructuring that invalidates existing paths
Impact: From this date forward, all code and documentation must assume these paths are stable; future changes should be additive rather than structural

Added stratified sample20 (nano/micro × O/W/W/O/W × table/text) for arXiv methodology validation.
Sampling treated as data-prep step, not run-scoped.
Finalized stratified20 sampling using rule-based strata_tags.tsv with soft HTML preference (html-bias=0.7).
Resulting sample: 20 papers (15 HTML, 5 PDF).
Missing (*,*,text) strata reflect reporting-style distribution, not pipeline error.
